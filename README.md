## Description

The objective of this project is to effectively manage a backend application that supplies data to a frontend page. The application boasts several crucial endpoints, providing comprehensive information on products, stock levels, statistics, as well as financial documents for both entries and exits.

## Motivation

The driving force behind developing this application was to aid a close friend in managing their small sports apparel and accessories business. With the aim of crafting a dynamic application, we planned software that could be accessed from any device.
